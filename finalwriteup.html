<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>We implemented a parallel SAT solver.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>We created a brute-force algorithm that attempts every single possible solution to an input SAT expression. We specify that an input SAT expression must consist of variables enumerated from x1, x2, x3, etc., and the negations of variables to create other literals are also valid. Our output will specify whether the input expression is satisfiable (in which case the satisfiable solution/s will be outputted) or whether the input expression has no solution (and isnâ€™t satisfiable). We believe that in the sequential version, the computationally expensive operations lie in the sheer number of possible solutions that must be attempted, which is upper-bounded by 2^num_vars each time, where num_vars is the number of variables in the input expression.
</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>

<p>We brute force every single possible solution by using pthreads to speed up the computations: specifically, we keep some shared variables between the pthreads and constantly check to see if any of the attempted solutions have been satisfiable and terminate all threads if we find a satisfiable solution. Otherwise, we run through all possible solutions and report that there is no solution found.</p> 

<p>We used C++ for our program and targeted the Xeon Phi, which has 60+ cores and could better handle the computational intensity of our program.</p> 

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>TBD.</p>

<h2>References</h2>

<p>No references were used.</p>

<h2>List of Work</h2>

<p>Equal work was performed by both project members.</p>
