Specify input as follows:

var_num,clause_num
clause1
clause2
...

As an example, consider this:
2,3
0,1
!0
!1

This is "(0 or 1) and (not 0) and (not 1)".

Please do not include multiple of the same variable in a clause, as that's
just degenerate and I didn't deal with the case explicitly.
Variables should be integers, starting from 0.

To run an example, first run the "make" command.
Run the solver with:
./sat input_file FLAGS

Allowable flags are:
-h (help)
-v (verbose)
-s# (split heuristic #)

The current implemented heuristics are:
s0: Pick arbitrary variable
s1: Pick variable which satisfies most clauses/occurs most often
